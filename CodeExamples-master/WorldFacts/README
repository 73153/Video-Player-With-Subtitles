The WorldFacts App has gone through a number of iterations over the
years as the capabilities of iOS have changed. Originally it started
as an example of how to construct custom table view cells with a
storyboard. For further details see the post:

For details on adding a storyboard segue to show the country detailed
view see the following post:

The steps to add a search bar to the table view controller are covered
in the following post:

The release of iOS 8 saw a number of changes to update and modernise
the code:

+ UISearchDisplayController is deprecated and replaced by the much
  cleaner UISearchController
+ Modules are now used instead of precompiled headers
+ The Storyboard is now universal
+ Include a launch screen storyboard
+ Autolayout is used
+ Dynamic Type is used for the content
+ Asset Catalogs for the icons and images
+ Base Internationalization
+ Remove old orientation handling code.

An OS X companion app has also been added to create and maintain the core
data stack. Full details on how to use Cocoa Bindings to create a simple
interface to Core Data are covered in the following post:

The geographic data used in this App is from GeoNames and used under
the Creative Commons Attributions License (see www.geonames.org).


=======================================================================
Model
=======================================================================

WorldFacts.xcdatamodeld

The core data model definition contains a single entity for the Country
managed object.

Country.h
Country.m

The generated NSManagedObject subclass

Country+Extensions.h
Country+Extensions.m

Private class extensions for the Country NSManagedObject subclass to
generate the section title used by the NSFetchedResultsController and
to import an initial set of geographic data from countries.plist.

=======================================================================
View
=======================================================================

Main.storyboard
The universal storyboard file used to create the table and details view


=======================================================================
Controllers
=======================================================================

UYLCountryTableViewController.h
UYLCountryTableViewController.m

The table view controller used to show the list of countries with
details on the capital and population and manage the search interface.
The table view controller implementation is a standard implementation
of an NSFetchResultsController.

UYLCountryViewController.h
UYLCountryViewController.m

The view controller used to show the detailed country view. This view
controller does almost nothing other than set up the view from the
Country object it is passed.

=======================================================================
App Delegate
=======================================================================

UYLAppDelegate.h
UYLAppDelegate.m

The App delegate is largely unmodified from the template code. It creates
the root view controller using a storyboard and initialises the core data
stack.
