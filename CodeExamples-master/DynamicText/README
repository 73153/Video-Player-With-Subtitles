=======================================================================

This is a example project showing how to respond to the user changing
the preferred text size.


The UYLTextStyleViewController shows the standard way to listen for
and respond to changes to the users preferred text size using the
built-in UIFont Text Styles.

The UYLScaledTextStyleViewController extends the basic approach by
showing how to scale the preferred fonts using a UIFontDescriptor.
A convenience method to return the scaled font is added as a
category of UIFont for this purpose.
