The RemindMe App is a demonstration on how to schedule local notifications

further details:

Since the original posting the example code has been updated to set the
minimum deployment target to be iOS 4.2. This has allowed some of the code
required to protect from unknown classes when deploying to iOS 3.x to be
removed. This project has been built using Xcode 4.4.1 building with a base SDK of iOS 5.1. It uses manual (non-ARC) based memory management.
