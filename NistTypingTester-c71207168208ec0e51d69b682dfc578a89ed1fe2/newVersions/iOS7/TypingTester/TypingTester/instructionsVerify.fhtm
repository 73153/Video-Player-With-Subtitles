        <p>
        On this screen you must type the password you just learned on the previous Practice screen. The password will not be visible. If you cannot remember the password, you can tap the '&lt;' button at the top of the screen to go back to the Practice screen and see the password. You must type the password correctly a specified number of times before you will be allowed to procede; that number is indicated by the Round number at the top of the screen.
