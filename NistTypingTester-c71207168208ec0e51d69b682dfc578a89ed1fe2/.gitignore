# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)

# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.

# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings

# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
#     throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
#     - unless they are "shared")
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 2 below

# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
#     get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
#     - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 1 above

# Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)

#   /(project-name).xcodeproj/
#     project.pbxproj
#     /project.xcworkspace/
