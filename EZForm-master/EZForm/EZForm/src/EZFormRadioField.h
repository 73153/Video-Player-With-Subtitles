/** A form field to handle selection from multiple choices.
 *
 *  EZFormRadioField is a subclass of EZFormTextField and so can
 *  accept input and display choices using any of the user views
 *  supported by EZFormTextField.
 *
 *  EZFormRadioField supports wiring up a UIPickerView to present
 *  the choices to the user, replacing a keyboard for input.
 *  Set the inputView property to a UIPickerView object, after
 *  wiring up a user view that supports becoming first responder
 *  (like a UITextField).
 *
 *  Alternatively, choices are commonly presented to the user in a table
 *  view.  EZForm provides EZFormRadioChoiceViewController as a
 *  convenience for presenting choices in a table view.
 *  The EZForm object and field key specifying the EZFormRadioField
 *  can be set on the EZFormRadioChoiceViewController object.
 *  It is up to the user to present the EZFormRadioChoiceViewController
 *  using whichever mechanism best fits the application (e.g.
 *  navigation push).
